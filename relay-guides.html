<h1 id="tdpfreebsdopenbsdguidesfortorrelays">TDP FreeBSD &amp; OpenBSD Guides for Tor Relays</h1>

<p>TDP produces two guides to building and configuring Tor relays for FreeBSD and OpenBSD.</p>

<p>There are two versions of each. The first is considered &#8216;production&#8217; quality and can be printed, translated and distributed. The second is considered &#8216;development&#8217; in that future ideas are noted, tested and confirmed. Contributations are more than welcomed.</p>

<p>One issue to note is recommended sysctl knobs. It is a difficult task to determine how to optimize a Tor relay. Tor is a (more or less) randomized routing network. That lack of consistency inhibits comparisons in performance beyond the obvious. Tor traffic on a relay can wildly vary day-to-day and month-to-month, regardless of any system optimization.</p>

<p>Contributions for NetBSD, DragonFly BSD, etc., are welcomed.</p>
