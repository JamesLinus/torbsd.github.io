<h2 id="tdpfreebsdopenbsdguidesfortorrelays"><strong>TDP</strong> FreeBSD &amp; OpenBSD Guides for Tor Relays</h2>

<p><strong>THESE ARE PRELIMINARY WORKS AT THE EARLY STAGE. ANONYMITY IS NOT A GAME, SO PLEASE DO NOT JUST ASSUME THESE GUIDES ARE FINE AS-IS. YOU HAVE BEEN WARNED.</strong></p>

<p><strong>TDP</strong> is creating two guides to building and configuring Tor relays for FreeBSD and OpenBSD.</p>

<p>There will be two parts to each.</p>

<p>The first part will be a &#8220;quick and dirty&#8221; guide to getting a Tor relay up quickly.</p>

<p>The second will be some other ideas for configuration, covering more optional enhancements.</p>

<p>One issue to note is that we view various optimization attempts as a
complex road, beyond just reading <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TCP/IP_Illustrated">Stevens&#8217; &#8220;TCP/IP Illustrated&#8221;</a>. It is not easy to understand the true effects of sysctl value changes and other kernel-level hacks, particularly with TCP traffic.</p>

<p>Tor is a (more or less) randomized routing network. That lack of
consistency inhibits comparisons in performance beyond the
obvious. Tor traffic on a relay can vary wildly day-to-day and
month-to-month, regardless of any system optimization. For a useful
overview of the problems with testing, see Kode Vicious&#8217;
<a href="https://queue.acm.org/detail.cfm?id=2732268">reply to &#8220;How Not Why&#8221;</a>
in ACM&#8217;s Queue magazine from February 2015. His emphasis on
repeatability tends to undercut many assumptions that are made about
testing a host on an anonymity network. It can quickly degenerate into
being a blind, counter-productive endeavor.</p>

<p>Nonetheless, there are some system-level changes we do recommend. But
do not expect long lists of sysctl values and graphs illustrating the
effects.</p>

<p><strong>TDP</strong> will look at optimizing Tor relay performance on
high-bandwidth BSDs in the future, but we suspect that the default
operating system installs (outside of some recommended changes) should
be sufficient for most relay operators&#8217; hardware and bandwidth. If
Netflix can serve
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL5U4wr86L4">one-third of peak internet traffic in North America</a>
with a default FreeBSD install, it&#8217;s likely sufficient for the vast
majority of Tor relays.</p>

<p>Contributions from other BSDs are welcomed.</p>
