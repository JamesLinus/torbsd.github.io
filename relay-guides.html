<h1 id="tdpfreebsdopenbsdguidesfortorrelays"><strong>TDP</strong> FreeBSD &amp; OpenBSD Guides for Tor Relays</h1>

<h2 id="thesearepreliminaryworksattheearlystage.anonymityisnotagamesopleasedonotjustassumetheseguidesarefineas-is.youhavebeenwarned.">THESE ARE PRELIMINARY WORKS AT THE EARLY STAGE. ANONYMITY IS NOT A GAME, SO PLEASE DO NOT JUST ASSUME THESE GUIDES ARE FINE AS-IS. YOU HAVE BEEN WARNED.</h2>

<p><strong>TDP</strong> is creating two guides to building and configuring Tor relays for FreeBSD and OpenBSD.</p>

<p>There are two versions of each. The first is considered &#8216;production&#8217; quality for printing, translation and distribution. The second is considered &#8216;development&#8217; in that future ideas are noted, tested and confirmed. Contributations are more than welcomed.</p>

<p>One issue to note is recommended sysctl knobs and other kernel-level hacks. It is a difficult task to determine how to optimize a Tor relay. Tor is a (more or less) randomized routing network. That lack of consistency inhibits comparisons in performance beyond the obvious. Tor traffic on a relay can wildly vary day-to-day and month-to-month, regardless of any system optimization. For a useful overview of the problems with testing, see &#8220;Kode Vicious&#8217;&#8221; <a href="https://queue.acm.org/detail.cfm?id=2732268">reply to &#8220;How Not Why&#8221;</a> in ACM&#8217;s Queue magazine. His emphasis on repeatability tends to undercut laundry lists of sysctl knobs for a host on an anonymity network. It can quickly degenerate into being a blind, counter-productive endeavor.</p>

<p>Contributions for NetBSD, DragonFly BSD, etc., are welcomed.</p>
