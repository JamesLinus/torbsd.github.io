<p>TDP produces two guides to building and configuring Tor relays for FreeBSD and OpenBSD.</p>

<p>There are two versions of each. The first is considered &#8216;production&#8217; quality and can be printed, translated, etc. The second is considered &#8216;development&#8217; in that future ideas are noted and confirmed.</p>
