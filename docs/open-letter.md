For over two years, the Tor BSD Diversity Project (TDP) worked to infuse the BSDs into the privacy-enhancing technology ecosystem (PETs).

One of our goals has been to expand the usage of the BSDs as a platform for Tor relays, public nodes in Tor anonymity network (https://www.torproject.org/). Tor is a critical tool for online free speech and privacy, frequently employed by journalists, human rights workers and those residing in repressive and censored environments.

Many people in the *BSD community know about TDP, whether from BSD conferences or our development work, such as porting Tor Browser to OpenBSD. We are committed to extending the presence of all the BSDs into the PETs ecosystem, yet we also believe there are untapped resources in our community that should be enlisted beyond our immediate circles.

It is well-known in the BSD community that there are dozens and dozens of major firms that employ BSD code and systems in their business, including your own. From enterprise-grade backup firms to internet service providers, the BSDs are a popular operating system option.

__Taking The Mozilla Foundation's decision to run public Tor relays in December 2014 as an example, we believe that if BSD commercial firms volunteered to operate and maintain Tor relays, it would be an enormous asset not just the PETs community who focus on enhancing uninhibited free speech and privacy, but also for the BSD community itself.__


New York Internet (https://www.nyi.net/), a data center firm that employs FreeBSD, committed to running two high-bandwidth relays, maintained by their staff with assistance from TDP. We hope their example, as with the Mozilla Foundation, can inspire other firms to follow suit.

Why would any firm operate a Tor relay?
 
First, running a Tor relay assists in expanding the most critical public tool for privacy and anonymity. Tor enables journalists' leads to be anonymous and client-attorney privilege to actually be privileged. In a time when freedom of speech is under attack internationally, Tor is a lifeline for millions.

Second, the majority of Tor relays run the Linux kernel. This operating system monoculture affects the overall integrity of the Tor network. It also means that the default OS for a new generation of young hackers is Linux, and not a BSD. Ultimately, it means a smaller pool in the future of potential staff familiar with the BSDs.

Running a Tor relay doesn't necessarily mean a significant commitment in terms of resources and bandwidth. And the relay doesn't necessarily have to allow "exit traffic", which tend to be the targets for IP blacklists. It would also be helpful if your firm even just ran a Tor bridge, essentially a private gateway into the Tor network for censored users.

Finally, there is a broader advantage to BSD firms running Tor relays: an example of your firm's commitment to a free and uncensored internet.

If you have further questions about running a Tor relay or bridge as an enterprise, please contact us. TDP looks forward to assisting your staff in configuring and maintaining BSD relays.
