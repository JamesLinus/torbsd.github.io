Greetings.

The Tor BSD Diversity Project (https://torbsd.github.io/) is surveying VPS and similar providers that provide BSD support about their acceptable use policy/terms of service (AUP/TOS) in regards to running nodes on the Tor public anonymity network (https://www.torproject.org/).

Our aim is to create a public list of Tor-friendly providers for anyone interested in running a BSD Tor relay or bridge without purchasing or maintaining server-grade hardware.

We believe is it both feasible and business-wise to allow customers to run Tor relays, with an understanding that Tor is a critical tool for the wider pool of users to enjoy uncensored and private access to the internet.

With that in mind, we would appreciate an authorized person from your organization to provide answers to our brief survey below based on your firm's service and AUP/TOS:

In regards to BSD services provided:

1. FreeBSD?

2. NetBSD?

3. OpenBSD?

4. Other BSD?

In regard to your service and running Tor:

5. Does your AUP/TOS explicitly state your policies towards running Tor by users?

6. Does your service allow Tor relays?

7. Is exit traffic from Tor relays allowed?

8. Tor bridges, which are privately listed nodes only allowing Tor traffic entering the network for users blocked from public Tor access?

9. If your entity's AUP/TOS restricts users from running Tor, would you consider engaging in further discussions with TDP about changing it?
