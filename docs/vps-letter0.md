Greetings.

The Tor BSD Diversity Project (https://torbsd.github.io/) is surveying VPS firms for their support of the BSD they provide, plus their acceptable use policies (AUP)towards running nodes for the Tor public anonymity network (https://www.torproject.org/).

Our aim is to provide a list of Tor-friendly providers for the general public for anyone interested in running a Tor relay or bridge in an accessible way without purchasing or maintaining server-grade hardware.

With that in mind, we would appreciate an authorized person from your first providing answers to our brief survey below based on your firm's AUP:

1. Does your firm allow Tor relays?

2. Exit traffic from Tor relays?

3. Tor bridges, which are privately listed which only allow entry Tor traffic for users blocked from public Tor network access?

4. Is your AUP something you would consider discussing further?
