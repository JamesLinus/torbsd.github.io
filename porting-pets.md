##Porting Targets for PETs##

There is a long list of applications spawned by the interest in privacy and anonymity solutions over the past several years.

This is a list of some of those applications. Most have not been ported to any of the BSDs. Many probably shouldn't be ported to the BSDs or any other sane operating system. But this list is at least an attempt to summarize the applications and provide relevant information for any *BSD developer interested in reviewing or porting them.
