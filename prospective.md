__DEVELOPMENT__


[Tor Browser for OpenBSD](https://github.com/torbsd/openbsd-ports/)

A POSIX-compliant port of TB enabling easier porting to other POSIX-compliant operating systems

currently at 25 releases, looking for acceptance in the OpenBSD ports system

development is ongoing into the indefinite future

An OpenBSD Tor Browser adds to Tor client diversity, engaging a security-conscious group of end-users.

POSIX-compliant implementation of Tor Browser. In addition to continued maintenance and acceptance into the OpenBSD ports system, future work includes pluggable transports, porting to FreeBSD, etc.

pluggable transports

automated build systems for both i386 and amd64 with OpenBSD snapshot releases

hardware for automated build systems

ongoing project

Tor Browser port to FreeBSD

Starting from the __TDP__ OpenBSD port of Tor Browser, FreeBSD should be a relatively easier porting target.

In planning phase

Release and ongoing development

Porting OpenBSD's [signify](http://man.openbsd.org/signify) to other OSs

As a single-purpose tool alternative to GnuPG for the purposes of signing and verifying digital signatures.

tor-alpha packages for OpenBSD

OpenBSD only allows stable applications in its port system, which the Tor Project's alpha releases more frequently address mitigation against evolving adversaries and threat models. __TDP__ would package tor-alpha and release __TDP__ signed versions.

Securing FreeBSD
While FreeBSD is strongly secure by default, additional measures can increase security, and decrease the operating system's footprint.

__RESEARCH__

diversity white paper: OS, geography, architecture, consensus

__INFRASTRUCTURE__

For __TDP__ to single-handedly run a lot of *BSD Tor relays would replace the operating system monoculture problem with a monoculture of relay operators. Therefore this list is limited as __TDP__ already operates high-bandwidth Tor relays.
