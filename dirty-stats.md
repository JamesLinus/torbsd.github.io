## Quick-and-Dirty Static Reports ##

This small project aims at producing simple, relevant reports about public Tor network relays for making broad conclusions related to network diversity. While primarily about providing a glance of the Tor network's current state, some may find it useful for presentations or other times static, broad snapshots of Tor are necessary.

__TDP__ focuses primarily on operating system diversity, specifically as related to BSD Unix, but such diversity should account for percentages versus absolute numbers, average bandwidth per relay by operating system, plus variables such as geographical diversity.

Currently, the reports are generated by shell scripts after retrieving the CSV data from [https://torstatus.rueckgr.at](https://torstatus.rueckgr.at) or [https://torstatus.blutmagie.de](https://torstatus.blutmagie.de). The shell scripts will be posted on our [GitHub repository](https://github.com/torbsd) as soon as they are in an intelligible form.

At some point, the whole operation will migrate to SQLite, and the data source will move to the newer json format.

### Current Reports ###

__[Country Codes Ranked by Bandwidth](bw-rank-cc.txt)__

Ranking in Kbps of bandwidth provided by each country code, along with the percentage of bandwidth provided by each country code. The output shows a clear over-concentation of Tor bandwidth in Germany, the US, France and the Netherlands.

__[Operating Systems Ranks by  Bandwidth](bw-rank-os.txt)__

Ranking in Kbps of bandwidth provided by each operating system, with the relevant percentages. The output of this script is what spawned __TDP__ in the first place: the overwhelming role of Linux in providing bandwidth to the Tor network.

__[Operating Systems Count](os-count.txt)__

Count of relays by operating system or platform, along with the percentage of each on the Tor network. Another report showing the lack of operating system diversity with Tor relay numbers by operating system or platform.

__[Number of Relays per Country Code](relays-by-cc.txt)__

Number of relays by country code. This report shows another ugly diversity picture: over a third of relays are in Germany or the US.

__[Country Codes without Public Tor Relays](tor-less-ccs.txt)__

This was was the first report created, based on the dearth of relays in a number of countries such as Pakistan, and the low number of relays in Brazil, India and Mexico. These statistics should indicate where further attention to Tor relay growth should be directed.
