The __Tor BSD Diversity Project (TDP)__ is an initiative seeking to extend the use of the BSD Unix operating systems in the Tor public anonymity network.

The Tor Project continues to play a critical role in anonymity and privacy solutions. With increasing surveillance and censorship, Tor is a vital tool, and the project has grown by leaps-and-bounds since originating with the US Naval Labs in the 1990’s. Hundreds of thousands rely on Tor’s operation in a world filled with threats to anonymity and privacy.

While recognizing that the Tor Project is dynamic open source project with a vibrant community, we are also concerned with the overwhelming GNU/Linux monoculture that is an Achilles’ Heel. Monocultures in nature are dangerous, as vulnerabilities are held in common across a broad spectrum. Diversity means single vulnerabilities are less likely to harm the entire ecosystem. In a global anonymity network, monocultures are potentially disastrous. A single kernel vulnerability in GNU/Linux impacting Tor relays could be devastating. We want to see a stronger Tor network, and we believe one critical ingredient for that is operating system diversity.

There are three aspects of the __TDP’s__ approach:

* To increase the number of Tor relays running *BSDs, focused on the server/network layer

* To develop a solid, Tor-compatible browser easily portable to other POSIX-based operating systems, focused on the client layer

* To engage the broader *BSD community about the Tor anonymity network

Current __TDP__ work includes:

* Guides for configuring FreeBSD and OpenBSD relays

* The creation of an OpenBSD Tor Browser port

* Organizing various events for engaging *BSD users about Tor, including birds-of-a-feather sessions and informal meetings

__TDP__ has a number of other projects in the pipeline, but ultimately our success depends on the broader *BSD community involvement.

* Join the Tor-BSD mailing list at http://lists.nycbug.org/mailman/listinfo/tor-bsd

* Clone the repo to start testing and contributing

* Run a *BSD Tor relay and join the BSD Buildbot at http://81.7.14.172

* Spread the word about __TDP__
