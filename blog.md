It's almost six months since we launched TDP in its current form. In March, the [GitHub repository] (https://github.com/torbsd) was created and we put some meat on the general ideas we had been toying around with.

We have had a lot of accomplishments since launching, but we should be clear that our weakest point has been marketing and publicity. Of course, it's something we're proud of, since a lot of projects just focus on the publicity part, and don't actually accomplish much else. Nevertheless, we will try to start keeping a clearer picture on our accomplishments and notes here.

The [presentation](http://www.queair.net/br-pres) at [BSDCon Brasil](http://2015.bsdcon.br.com] was a success, with the first BSD relays launched in that country, and now account for up to a third of observed Tor bandwidth. More relays should be coming online in Brazil soon, and we were told of a few BSD bridges that were created.

Interestingly, one of the relays, running on a residential connection, had to be migrated to a bridge. Apparently, the relay admin's online banking provider blocked the relay's IP, not because it was an exit relay, but just becuase it was a public Tor IP.
