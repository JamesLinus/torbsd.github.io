The Tor BSD Diversity Project (TDP) is proud to announce the release of Tor Browser (TB) version 5.0.3 for OpenBSD.

TDP (https://torbsd.github.io) is an effort to extend the use of the BSD Unixes into the Tor ecosystem, from the desktop to the network.

The 5.0.3 release is the sixth release of the Tor Browser from TDP.

To install TB for OpenBSD, please see http://mirrors.nycbug.org/pub/snapshots/packages/amd64/README

TDP is focused on diversifying the Tor network, with TB being the flagship project. Additional efforts are made to increase the number of *BSD relays on the Tor network.

Since its launch in March 2015, TDP has made significant contributions. In addition to the TB releases, both BSDCan and BSDCon Brasil featured TDP-focused meetings.

In early October, the TDP focused presentation (http://www.queair.net/br-pres) prompted a significant increase in Tor relays in Brazil. Before the presentation, there were around 22 Tor relays, all of which were Linux in addition to two Windows nodes.

In the weeks after the presentation, several new *BSD Tor relays appeared, accounting for up to 35% of bandwidth provided by new Tor relays in Brazil.

Finally, TDP is working to convince BSD-using businesses to follow Mozilla's December 2014 example to run Tor relays. At this point, New York Internet has committed to running two high-bandwidth relays, one FreeBSD and the other OpenBSD, at its facility in Bridgewater, New Jersey.

TDP's source code repository resides at http://github.com/torbsd.

TDP is seeking funding to continue and extend its efforts. Please contact us if interested in assisting TDP, allowing us to dedicate more time to the project.
