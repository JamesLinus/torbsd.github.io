# TDP FreeBSD & OpenBSD Guides for Tor Relays #

TDP produces two guides to building and configuring Tor relays for FreeBSD and OpenBSD.

There are two versions of each. The first is considered 'production' quality and can be printed, translated and distributed. The second is considered 'development' in that future ideas are noted, tested and confirmed. Contributations are more than welcomed.

One issue to note is recommended sysctl knobs. It is a difficult task to determine how to optimize a Tor relay. Tor is a (more or less) randomized routing network. That lack of consistency inhibits comparisons in performance beyond the obvious. Tor traffic on a relay can wildly vary day-to-day and month-to-month, regardless of any system optimization.

Contributions for NetBSD, DragonFly BSD, etc., are welcomed.
