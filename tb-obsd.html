<h2 id="portingtorbrowsertoopenbsd">Porting Tor Browser to OpenBSD</h2>

<p><strong>TDP&#8217;s</strong> flagship project is porting <a href="https://www.torproject.org/projects/torbrowser.html.en">Tor Browser</a> to <a href="http://www.openbsd.org">OpenBSD</a>.</p>

<p>There are currently Tor Browser (TB) builds available for Windows, Apple&#8217;s OSX, Linux and Android operating systems. There is no support for any of the BSD Unixes.</p>

<p><strong>TDP&#8217;s</strong> TB is currently development, therefore it should not be relied upon for strong anonymity and privacy.</p>

<p>ers</p>

<h3 id="whyopenbsd">Why OpenBSD?</h3>

<p>OpenBSD is not running on millions of desktops, laptops or other similar client-end devices. Nevertheless, there is a strong case for OpenBSD to be the initial platform for porting TB.</p>

<p>Much of this piece is derived from <a href="http://www.openbsd.org/goals.html">OpenBSD&#8217;s Project Goals</a>.</p>

<h4 id="openbsdsstrictfocusonsecuritythroughcleancode">OpenBSD&#8217;s Strict Focus on Security Through Clean Code</h4>

<p>&#8220;Hacks&#8221; and workarounds are not only discouraged, they are also not permitted. This makes porting OpenBSD-originating software easier. In cases in which OpenBSD is porting software from the &#8220;upstream,&#8221; such as the Tor Brower, OpenBSD strongly endorses communicating those changes back to the original software developers.</p>

<h4 id="openbsdsadherencetostandards">OpenBSD&#8217;s Adherence to Standards</h4>

<p>Software built to common standards, such as <a href="http://pubs.opengroup.org/onlinepubs/9699919799/">POSIX</a> and <a href="http://www.ansi.org/">ANSI</a>, makes porting their software to other POSIX operating systems easier.</p>

<h4 id="openbsdbuildsportabletools">OpenBSD Builds Portable Tools</h4>

<p>OpenBSD builds tools for portability, many of which appear on other operating systems. <a href="http://www.openssh.com">OpenSSH</a> is the most common tool for managing Unix servers remotely, bundled in systems and devices. It become ubiquitous not only because it&#8217;s extremely secure, but also because the portable version makes incorporating into other systems relatively simple.</p>

<h4 id="openbsdbuildstoolstomakeallsoftwarebetter">OpenBSD Builds Tools to Make All Software Better</h4>

<p>Other OpenBSD tools can be ported that will make other software more secure. Programs such as <a href="http://www.openbsd.org/cgi-bin/man.cgi?query=arc4random&amp;apropos=0&amp;sec=0&amp;arch=default&amp;manpath=OpenBSD-current">arc4random(3)</a>, <a href="http://www.libressl.org/">libressl</a> and <a href="http://www.openbsd.org/cgi-bin/man.cgi/OpenBSD-current/man1/signify.1?query=signify">signify(1)</a> remove the need for bloated or sloppy solutions to basic problems. Take the example of <a href="https://www.torproject.org/docs/verifying-signatures.html.en">verifying the signatures of Tor Browser</a> to confirm the Tor Browser download hasn&#8217;t been tampered with. The instructions direct users to download <a href="https://gnupg.org/">GnuPG</a>, a large complex application that can provides functality far beyond just verifying software&#8217;s digital fingerprints.</p>

<p>signify(1) is designed respecting the standard Unix principle as a tool which does one thing and does it right. Instead of having a user walk through instructions on how to download, install and use GnuPG, including signify(1) in an operating system can make the task simple and painless.</p>

<h4 id="openbsdslicensingispermissive">OpenBSD&#8217;s Licensing is Permissive</h4>

<p>BSD licenses are simple and clear, designed to be read and understood by anyone with thirty seconds to spare without the assistance of legal counsel. OpenBSD e</p>
