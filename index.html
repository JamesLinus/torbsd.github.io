<p>The Tor-BSD Diversity Project is an initiative that seeks to extend
the use of the BSD Unix operating systems in the
<a href="http://www.torproject.org">Tor public anonymity network</a>.</p>

<p>BSD Unix is an open source operating system family noted for its
security and stability. The major BSD projects include
<a href="http://www.freebsd.org">FreeBSD</a>, <a href="http://www.netbsd.org">NetBSD</a> and
<a href="http://www.openbsd.org">OpenBSD</a>, with a number of tangential
projects including <a href="http://www.pfsense.org">pfSense</a>,
<a href="http://www.freenas.org">FreeNAS</a> and
<a href="http://www.pcbsd.org">PC-BSD</a>. BSD software such as
<a href="http://www.openssh.org">OpenSSH</a> is the default communication tool
for innumerable devices on the internet. And BSD software is renowned
for its role in internet operations since its earliest days.</p>

<p>The Tor Project plays a critical role in anonymity and privacy
solutions. With ever-increasing surveillance and censorship, Tor is a
vital tool, and the project has grown by leaps-and-bounds since its
origin as a US Naval Labs project in the 1990’s. Hundreds of thousands
rely on Tor’s operation in a world filled with threats to anonymity
and privacy.</p>

<p>While recognizing that the Tor Project is an admirable project that is
open source and well-documented with a vibrant community, we also
worry about the overwhelming GNU/Linux monoculture that is an
Achilles’ Heel. Monocultures in nature are dangerous, as
vulnerabilities are held in common across a broad spectrum. Diversity
means single vulnerabilities are less likely to harm the entire
ecosystem. In a global anonymity network, monocultures are potentially
disastrous. A single kernel vulnerability in GNU/Linux that impacting
Tor relays could be devastating. We want to see a stronger Tor
network, and we believe one critical ingredient for that is operating
system diversity.</p>

<p>There are three aspects of the TDP’s approach:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>to increase the number of Tor relays running BSDs, focused on the server/network layer</p></li>
<li><p>to develop a solid, Tor-compatible browser easily portable to other POSIX-based operating systems, focused on the client layer</p></li>
<li><p>to engage the broader BSD community about the Tor anonymity network</p></li>
</ul>

<p>Current TDP work includes:</p>

<ul>
<li><p><a href="/relay-guides.html">guides for configuring FreeBSD and OpenBSD relays</a></p></li>
<li><p><a href="https://github.com/torbsd/openbsd-ports">the creation of an OpenBSD port for the Tor Browser Bundle</a></p></li>
<li><p>various events for engaging BSD users about Tor, including birds-of-a-feather sessions and informal meetings</p></li>
</ul>

<p>We look forward to inquiries and involvement in TDP. Please use this
<a href="/contact.html">contact form</a> form for any communications.</p>
