<p>The <strong>Tor BSD Diversity Project (TDP)</strong> is an initiative that seeks to extend
the use of the BSD Unix operating systems in the
<a href="https://www.torproject.org">Tor public anonymity network</a>.</p>

<p>BSD Unix is an open source operating system family noted for its
security and stability. The major BSD projects include
<a href="https://www.freebsd.org">FreeBSD</a>, <a href="https://www.netbsd.org">NetBSD</a>,
<a href="http://www.openbsd.org">OpenBSD</a> and <a href="http://www.dragonflybsd.org">DragonFly BSD</a>, with a number of tangential projects including <a href="https://www.pfsense.org">pfSense</a>, <a href="https://www.freenas.org">FreeNAS</a> and <a href="https://www.pcbsd.org">PC-BSD</a>. BSD software such as <a href="http://www.openssh.com">OpenSSH</a> is the default communication tool for innumerable devices on the internet. And BSD software is renowned for its role in internet infrastructure since its earliest days.</p>

<p>The Tor Project continues to play a critical role in anonymity and privacy
solutions. With increasing surveillance and censorship, Tor is a
vital tool, and the project has grown by leaps-and-bounds since its
origin as a US Naval Labs project in the 1990’s. Hundreds of thousands rely on Tor’s operation in a world filled with threats to anonymity
and privacy.</p>

<p>While recognizing that the Tor Project is vibrant open source project
with a vibrant community, we are also concerned with the overwhelming GNU/Linux monoculture that is an Achilles’ Heel. Monocultures in nature are dangerous, as vulnerabilities are held in common across a broad spectrum. Diversity
means single vulnerabilities are less likely to harm the entire
ecosystem. In a global anonymity network, monocultures are potentially
disastrous. A single kernel vulnerability in GNU/Linux impacting
Tor relays could be devastating. We want to see a stronger Tor
network, and we believe one critical ingredient for that is operating
system diversity.</p>

<p>There are three aspects of the <strong>TDP’s</strong> approach:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>to increase the number of Tor relays running BSDs, focused on the server/network layer</p></li>
<li><p>to develop a solid, Tor-compatible browser easily portable to other POSIX-based operating systems, focused on the client layer</p></li>
<li><p>to engage the broader BSD community about the Tor anonymity network</p></li>
</ul>

<p>Current <strong>TDP</strong> work includes:</p>

<ul>
<li><p><a href="relay-guides.html">guides for configuring FreeBSD and OpenBSD relays</a></p></li>
<li><p><a href="https://github.com/torbsd/openbsd-ports">the creation of an OpenBSD Tor Browser port</a></p></li>
<li><p>organizing various events for engaging BSD users about Tor, including birds-of-a-feather sessions and informal meetings</p></li>
</ul>

<p>We look forward to inquiries and involvement in <strong>TDP</strong>. Please use this
