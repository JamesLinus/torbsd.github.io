<p>A Blog, or More Accurately, a Centralized Location for Announces and Notes</p>

<p>It&#8217;s almost six months since we launched TDP in its current form. In March, the <a href="https://github.com/torbsd">GitHub repository</a> was created and we put some meat on the general ideas we had been toying around with.</p>

<p>We have had a lot of accomplishments since launching, but we should be clear that our weakest point has been marketing and publicity. Of course, it&#8217;s something we&#8217;re proud of, since a lot of projects just focus on the publicity part, and don&#8217;t actually accomplish much. Nevertheless, we will try to start keeping a clearer picture on our accomplishments and notes here.</p>

<p>We announced the sixth release of Tor Browser two days ago, version 5.0.3, which was a major milestone for us.</p>

<p>The presentation at BSDCon Brasil was a success, with the first BSD relays launched in that country, and now account for up to a third of observed Tor bandwidth. More relays should be coming online in Brazil soon, and we were told of a few BSD bridges that were created.</p>

<p>Interestingly, one of the relays, running on a residential connection, had to be migrated to a bridge. Apparently, the relay admin&#8217;s online banking provider blocked the relay&#8217;s IP, not because it was an exit relay, but just becuase it was a public Tor IP.
