<p>Our First Bells by gman999</p>

<p>It&#8217;s almost six months since we launched TDP in its current form. In March, the <a href="https://github.com/torbsd">GitHub repository</a> was created and we put some meat on the general ideas we had been toying around with.</p>

<p>We count a lot of accomplishments since launching, but we should be clear that our weakest point has been marketing and publicity. Of course, it&#8217;s something we&#8217;re proud of, since a lot of projects just focus on the publicity part, and don&#8217;t actually accomplish much else. Nevertheless, we will try to start keeping a clearer picture on our accomplishments and notes here.</p>

<p>Quite frankly in BSD land, all fluff and no product doesn&#8217;t get you much credibility. Talk is considered cheap, while good code is priceless.</p>

<p>We announced the sixth release of Tor Browser two days ago, version 5.0.3, which was a major milestone for us. We were excited by some of the <a href="https://lists.torproject.org/pipermail/tor-talk/2015-October/039351.html">feeback</a>.</p>

<p>The <a href="http://www.queair.net/br-pres">presentation</a> at <a href="http://2015.bsdcon.com.br">BSDCon Brasil</a> was a success, with the first BSD relays launched in that country, and now account for up to a third of observed Tor bandwidth. More relays should be coming online in Brazil soon, and we were told of a few BSD bridges that were created.</p>

<p>Interestingly, one of the relays, running on a residential connection, had to be migrated to a bridge. Apparently, the relay admin&#8217;s online banking provider blocked the relay&#8217;s IP, not because it was an exit relay, but just becuase it was a public Tor IP.</p>

<p>Finally, we will be catching up with the publicity we should have previously done in the near future. Bear with this blog&#8217;s format, we are not really the WordPress types, if you hadn&#8217;t guessed already.</p>

<p>OS Diversity and Beyond by gman999</p>

<p>TDP is focused on operating system diversification for Tor. But the need for diversity is more than just operating systems. A quick browse at <a href="https://torstatus.rueckgr.at">one of the Tor Status sites</a>, or more specifically the <a href="https://torstatus.rueckgr.at/network_detail.php">Network Statistics Graphs</a> the lack of geographical diversity is disturbing.</p>

<p>Parsing the list of Tor relays, there are a number of ISO 8166&#8211;1 two-digit country codes <a href="tor-less-ccs.txt">that have no relay</a>. Spreading the Tor network out to those countries should become an obligation for everyone.</p>

<p>Also disturbing is the concentration in observed Tor bandwidth <a href="relays-by-cc.txt">by country code</a>. Germany and the US each contain more than a thousand relays accounting for around a third of the total number of Tor relays globally.</p>

<p>We will output more data about geographical diversity in the future, but in the meantime, if you have contacts, friends or families in the underrepresented country codes, now is the time to explore the possibility of getting more Tor relays there.</p>

<p>Tor Browser version 5.0.3 for OpenBSD by gman999</p>

<p>The Tor BSD Diversity Project (TDP) is proud to announce the release of Tor Browser (TB) version 5.0.3 for OpenBSD.</p>

<p><a href="https://torbsd.github.io">TDP</a> is an effort to extend the use of the BSD Unixes into the Tor ecosystem, from the desktop to the network.</p>

<p>The 5.0.3 release is the sixth release of the Tor Browser from TDP.</p>

<p>To install TB for OpenBSD, please see <a href="http://mirrors.nycbug.org/pub/snapshots/packages/amd64/README">http://mirrors.nycbug.org/pub/snapshots/packages/amd64/README</a>.</p>

<p>TDP is focused on diversifying the Tor network, with TB being the flagship project. Additional efforts are made to increase the number of *BSD relays on the Tor network.</p>

<p>Since its launch in March 2015, TDP has made significant contributions. In addition to the TB releases, both BSDCan and BSDCon Brasil featured TDP-focused meetings.</p>

<p>In early October, a <a href="http://www.queair.net/br-pres">TDP presentation</a> prompted a significant increase in Tor relays in Brazil. Before the presentation, there were around 22 Tor relays, all of which were Linux in addition to two Windows nodes.</p>

<p>In the weeks after the presentation, several new *BSD Tor relays appeared, accounting for up to 35% of observed Tor bandwidth in Brazil.</p>

<p>Finally, TDP is working to convince BSD-using businesses to follow Mozilla&#8217;s December 2014 example to run Tor relays. At this point, New York Internet has committed to running two high-bandwidth relays, one FreeBSD and the other OpenBSD, at its facility in Bridgewater, New Jersey.</p>

<p>TDP&#8217;s source code repository resides at <a href="https://github.com/torbsd">https://github.com/torbsd</a>.</p>

<p>TDP is seeking funding to continue and extend its efforts. Please contact us if interested in assisting TDP, allowing us to dedicate more time to the project.</p>
