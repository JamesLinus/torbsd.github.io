<h2 id="tdpprojects"><strong>TDP</strong> Projects</h2>

<p><strong>TDP</strong> focuses on an array of projects which culminate in an effort to diversify the Tor anonymity network with more *BSD Unix engagement. Each item relates to that goal on some level.</p>

<p>Some projects are simple, one-off efforts which require some maintenance, while others are more labor-intensive and driven by upstream development.</p>

<h3 id="torbrowserportingtoopenbsd">Tor Browser Porting to OpenBSD</h3>

<p>Porting Tor Browser (TB) to OpenBSD is our flagship project. It was our initial endeavor, and requires the most attention. Porting TB means a lot of efforts in tracking the upstream Tor Browser, in addition to working the port into a strict OpenBSD ecosystem. We are in some initial discussions to get TB ported to other BSDs.</p>

<h3 id="bsdtorrelayguides">BSD Tor Relay Guides</h3>

<p>It&#8217;s not rocket science to run a Tor relay on any of the BSDs. But there is some useful utility in providing simple, step-by-step instructions on building a relay. Our initial targets are FreeBSD and OpenBSD, and some interest has been expressed from others to do the same for other BSDs.</p>
