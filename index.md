# The Tor BSD Diversity Project #

The Tor-BSD Diversity Project is an initiative that seeks to extend
the use of the BSD Unix operating systems in the
[Tor public anonymity network](http://www.torproject.org).

BSD Unix is an open source operating system family noted for its
security and stability. The major BSD projects include
[FreeBSD](http://www.freebsd.org), [NetBSD](http://www.netbsd.org) and
[OpenBSD](http://www.openbsd.org), with a number of tangential
projects including [pfSense](http://www.pfsense.org),
[FreeNAS](http://www.freenas.org) and
[PC-BSD](http://www.pcbsd.org). BSD software such as
[OpenSSH](http://www.openssh.org) is the default communication tool
for innumerable devices on the internet. And BSD software is renowned
for its role in internet operations since its earliest days.

The Tor Project plays a critical role in anonymity and privacy
solutions. With ever-increasing surveillance and censorhip, Tor is a
vital tool, and the project has grown by leaps-and-bounds since its
origin as a US Naval Labs project in the 1990’s. Hundreds of thousands
rely on Tor’s operation in a world filled with threats to anonymity
and privacy.

While recognizing that the Tor Project is an admirable project that is
open source and well-documented with a vibrant community, we also
worry about the overwhelming GNU/Linux monoculture that is an
Achilles’ Heel. Monocultures in nature are dangerous, as
vulnerabilities are held in common across a broad spectrum. Diversity
means single vulnerabilities are less likely to harm the entire
ecosystem. In a global anonymity network, monocultures are potentially
disastrous. A single kernel vulnerability in GNU/Linux that impacting
Tor relays could be devastating. We want to see a stronger Tor
network, and we believe one critical ingredient for that is operating
system diversity.

There are three aspects of the TDP’s approach

* to increase the number of Tor relays running BSDs, focused on the server/network layer
*  to develop a solid, Tor-compatible browser easily portable to other POSIX-based operating systems, focused on the client layer
*  to engage the broader BSD community about the Tor anonymity network

Currently, the TDP implementation plan includes:
* documentation for configuring FreeBSD and OpenBSD relays
* the creation of an OpenBSD port for the Tor Browser Bundle
* various events for engaging BSD users about Tor, including birds-of-a-feather sessions and informal meetings

We look forward to inquiries and involvement in TDP. Please use this
contact form form for any communications.
