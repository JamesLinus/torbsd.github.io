## Welcome ##

The __Tor BSD Diversity Project (TDP)__ is an initiative seeking to
extend the use of the BSD Unix operating systems in the
[Tor public anonymity network](https://www.torproject.org).

BSD Unix is an open source operating system family noted for its
security and stability. The major BSD projects include
[FreeBSD](https://www.freebsd.org), [NetBSD](https://www.netbsd.org),
[OpenBSD](http://www.openbsd.org) and
[DragonFly BSD](http://www.dragonflybsd.org), with a number of
tangential projects including [pfSense](https://www.pfsense.org),
[FreeNAS](https://www.freenas.org) and
[PC-BSD](https://www.pcbsd.org). BSD software such as
[OpenSSH](http://www.openssh.com) is the default communication tool
for innumerable devices on the internet. BSD software is renowned for
its Internet infrastructure role since its earliest days.

The Tor Project continues to play a critical component in anonymity
and privacy solutions. With increasing surveillance and censorship,
Tor is a vital tool, and the project has grown by leaps-and-bounds
since originating with the US Naval Labs in the 1990’s. Hundreds of
thousands rely on Tor’s operation in a world filled with threats to
anonymity and privacy.

While recognizing the Tor Project is a dynamic open source project
with a vibrant community, we are also concerned with the overwhelming
GNU/Linux monoculture that is an Achilles’ Heel. Monocultures in
nature are dangerous, as vulnerabilities are held in common across a
broad spectrum. Diversity means single vulnerabilities are less likely
to harm the entire ecosystem. In a global anonymity network,
monocultures are potentially disastrous. A single kernel vulnerability
in GNU/Linux impacting Tor relays could be devastating. We want to see
a stronger Tor network, and we believe one critical ingredient for
that is operating system diversity.

There are three aspects of the __TDP’s__ approach:

* Increase the number of Tor relays running BSDs.  We envision this
  happening by increasing the total number of relays, not by
  convincing operators of relays using non-BSD operating systems to
  switch;

* To make the Tor Browser Bundle available under BSD operating systems
  using native packaging mechanisms.  Our first target is OpenBSD;

* To engage the broader BSD community about the Tor anonymity network
  and the place that BSD Unix should occupy in the privacy community
  at large.

Current __TDP__ work includes:

* [Guides for configuring and running FreeBSD and OpenBSD relays](relay-guides.html);

* [The creation of OpenBSD Tor Browser Bundle ports](https://github.com/torbsd/openbsd-ports);

* Organizing various events for engaging BSD users about Tor,
  including birds-of-a-feather sessions and informal meetings.

We look forward to inquiries and involvement in __TDP__.  Please see
