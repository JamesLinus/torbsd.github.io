<h1 id="frequentlyaskedquestions">Frequently Asked Questions</h1>

<p>Below are some typical questions about <strong>TDP</strong>. Feel free to <a href="/contact.html">contact us</a> for questions or comments not mentioned.</p>

<h2 id="iftdpisconcernedaboutoperatingsystemdiversitywhydoesitjustfocusonbsdsystemsandnototheroperatingsystemssuchasilluminos">If <strong>TDP</strong> is concerned about operating system diversity, why does it just focus on BSD Systems, and not other operating systems such as Illuminos?</h2>

<p>Our background and experience are in BSD Unix land, therefore that is the focus of <strong>TDP</strong>. It is critical to note that our code and materials, in addition to the licensing, respects established standards and provides liberal BSD licensing. <strong>TDP</strong> is commited to portability and interoperability.</p>

<p>In other words, if someone wanted to take our code and materials and utilize it to spawn a Plan 9 or BeOS project with the same eye on diversity, <strong>TDP</strong> allows them to skip at least some of the initial stages.</p>

<h2 id="whydidtorbrowserworkstartwithopenbsdisntfreebsdmorepopular">Why did Tor Browser work start with OpenBSD? Isn&#8217;t FreeBSD more popular?</h2>

<p>FreeBSD may very well be more widely used, but operating system usage statistics are wildly untrustworthy, particularly when the BSD license doesn&#8217;t require users to publicize using BSD code.</p>

<p>However, while all the BSDs aim to be standards-compliant, OpenBSD is the most orthodox in this respect. If it runs on OpenBSD and is accepted into the base or ports trees, it is likely the easiest operating system to port software <strong>from</strong>. There are popular and less known examples to mention, such as OpenSSH, arc4random, OpenNTPD and for those who only read Slashdot.org over the past year, LibreSSL is quickly gaining momentum as another piece of portable OpenBSD code.</p>

<p>With a production-quality OpenBSD Tor Browser port, FreeBSD, NetBSD, DragonFly BSD, etc., ports should be trivial.</p>
